Simple Chatbox
==============

This is a very simple client-server based chatbox written in java during my second semester computer science course at the University of Applied Science Berlin.
You can find more informations about the task [here](http://people.f4.htw-berlin.de/~weberwu/info2/labs/Exer1.shtml).

You have to run the server class first and connect the clients after.

For our first [task](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vue3k74prboq934/exercise-sockets.pdf?dl=0) in distributed systems I added the ability to call server side methods. 
To call a method on the server just type the method name in the chat message with a '.' as prefix. Methods can take parameters,
just add them after the method name in the chat message with a space between each parameter.
