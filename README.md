Simple Chatbox
==============

This is a very simple client-server based chatbox written in java during my second semester computer science course at the University of Applied Science Berlin.
You can find more informations about the task [here](http://people.f4.htw-berlin.de/~weberwu/info2/labs/Exer1.shtml).

You have to run the server class first and connect the clients after.
